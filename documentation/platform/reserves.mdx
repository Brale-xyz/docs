title: "Reserves"
---

Brale-issued fiat-backed stablecoins are designed to be **fully reserved (1:1)**. This means the outstanding token supply is backed by reserve assets held within Brale’s reserve structure, with operational controls and independent verification.

This page provides an overview of typical reserve composition, how reserves are managed, and how Brale’s regulated posture relates to reserve-backed issuance.

## Reserves composition

Brale’s reserve design typically uses high-quality, liquid assets, including:

- Cash held at U.S. banks
- Liquid money market funds that invest in U.S. government securities
- Short-duration U.S. Treasury Bills

## How reserves are managed

Brale’s reserve management and financial controls are designed for auditable, repeatable operations:

- **Segregated accounts:** reserve assets are held by Brale in segregated accounts.
- **Daily reconciliation:** automated matching of on-chain supply to corresponding fiat balances.
- **Monthly independent attestations:** reserves and 1:1 backing are verified monthly by an independent CPA firm.

## Licensing

Brale operates as a regulated money services business and licensed money transmitter:

- Registered with FinCEN as an MSB
- Maintains Money Transmitter Licenses and/or qualifies for exemptions across U.S. jurisdictions (NMLS ID available)

These licenses carry financial, bonding, and compliance requirements designed to protect funds.
