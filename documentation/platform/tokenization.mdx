title: "Tokenization"
---

Brale’s tokenization API lets you issue and operate your own tokens, such as a local-currency stablecoin, a points system, or a non-fiat asset, while using Brale for:

- Key custody
- Account and wallet orchestration
- Mint and burn execution on supported chains
- Unified reporting across tokenization activity

When utilizing Brale tokenization, you are responsible for coordinating the reserve or backing assets, onramps, and offramps. Brale gives you the multi-chain issuance engine to match off chain reserves to onchain supply.

## How you build with tokenization

At a high level:

1. Brale enables tokenization mode for your account.
2. Brale configures your token on the chains you need.
3. You use Accounts and Addresses to manage wallets and balances.
4. You mint, burn, and transfer tokens via the tokenization API.
5. You monitor activity via tokenization transaction reporting.
