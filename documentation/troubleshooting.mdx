# Troubleshooting & Known Pitfalls

Use this checklist when integrating and operating at volume.

## Auth & tokens

- Tokens expire in ~60 minutes; refresh using `expires_in` before expiry.
- 401 → refresh token, retry idempotently. Do not keep reusing an expired token.

## Idempotency

- Required on POST create endpoints (e.g., transfers). Missing key → 400.
- Never reuse an Idempotency-Key with a different payload or URI (422).
- Do not send Idempotency-Key on GETs.
- Best practice: generate one UUID per logical action and persist it so retries reuse the same key.

## IDs (account_id vs address_id)

- IDs are KSUIDs (26-char, time-sortable), not UUIDs—copy/paste carefully.
- `address_id` is the universal source/destination primitive (wallets and fiat endpoints).
- Internal (custodial) addresses are auto-created per account/chain; generally you do not create them manually.
- If an address appears under an account-scoped endpoint but not via a global lookup, use the account-scoped endpoint.

## Transfers: value_type + transfer_type

- Source and destination are always address-based; both carry `value_type` and `transfer_type`.
- Use valid pairs from Coverage (value types and transfer types are case-sensitive).
- Branding applies to ACH only (not wire/RTP).

## Pagination & reconciliation

- List transfers with pagination tokens; store transfer id, idempotency key, timestamps, status, and provider references.
- Poll with backoff; avoid tight loops.

## Headers

- Required: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, `Content-Type: application/json` on JSON POSTs, `Idempotency-Key` on create POSTs.
- Avoid sending unexpected headers (including Idempotency-Key) on GET.

## When in doubt

- Re-read Coverage for exact identifiers (case and spelling).
- Verify example paths and enums against the OpenAPI spec and Postman collection.
