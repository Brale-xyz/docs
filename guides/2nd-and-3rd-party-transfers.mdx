title: "Branded Transfers"

<p class="intro-subheading">
  We've expanded the Transfers endpoint to support both 2nd and 3rd party ACH transfers.
</p>

When Brale initiates a transfer on behalf of your business or your customer's business, 2nd/3rd-party branding ensures the **receiver sees the intended business name** on the ACH transaction (instead of “Brale”).

Branded transfers are supported for ach_debit, ach_credit, same_day_ach_credit.

To learn more and see a demo, schedule a meeting to [talk to sales](https://brale.xyz/contact).

## Creating 2nd/3rd Party Transfers branded transfers

**POST** `https://api.brale.xyz/accounts/account_id/transfers`

Use the `brand` object to control the business name displayed to the receiver. Pass the target account inside the request body under `brand.account_id`. The `brand.account_id` is the **Account whose name should appear** to the receiver.

- `account_id: aB3hJkL9mN2PqRsTuvWxyz1234` = `Company 1`
  - Your business 
- `account_id: 34fcsGrCgN0Z9zC1v55eP0I6AKW` = `Company 2`
  - Your customer

If you omit `brand`, the transfer uses your default branding.

> **Definitions**
>
> - **2nd-party**: You are the brand (display name = your business).
> - **3rd-party**: Your customer's business is the brand (display name = your customer).
