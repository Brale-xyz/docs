title: "Get your custodial address_ids"
description: "A custodial account_id is a internal (custodial) addresses. You can use custodial accounts to manage balances for specific workflows, or to hold onchain balances for others. To retrieve address_ids for transfers and balances."
---

Use the Addresses API to fetch your custodial `address_id` values. These are required for transfers and balance checks.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prerequisite: get your account_id and a bearer token">
    - Get `account_id`: [How to get your account_id](/guides/how-to/get-your-account-id)
    - Get a bearer token using your client credentials:

    ```bash
    curl --request POST \
      --url https://auth.brale.xyz/oauth2/token \
      --header 'Authorization: Basic ${BASE_64_OF(client_id:client_secret)}' \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
      --data grant_type=client_credentials
    ```

    Use `Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}` for the next call.
  </Step>
  <Step title="List your addresses">
    Call `GET /accounts/{account_id}/addresses` to retrieve custodial and external addresses. Filter for `type=internal` to get custodial addresses managed by Brale.

    ```bash
    curl --request GET \
      --url "https://api.brale.xyz/accounts/${ACCOUNT_ID}/addresses" \
      --header "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}"
    ```

    Example response (truncated):

    ```json
    {
      "addresses": [
        {
          "id": "2MhCCIHulVdXrHiEuQDJvnKbSkl",
          "name": "Custodial",
          "status": "active",
          "type": "internal",
          "address": "0xB2952EDba91FeAeaDBeCC4030203367A5B9b4701",
          "transfer_types": [
            "avalanche",
            "ethereum",
            "base",
            "polygon",
            "solana"
          ]
        }
        // ...
      ]
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pick the right address_id">
    - Use `id` from an entry with `type=internal` for onchain/offchain transfers and balance checks.
    - Choose an address that supports the `transfer_type` you need (e.g., `base`, `solana`, `ethereum`).
    - Keep this `address_id` for subsequent calls (e.g., transfers, balances).
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  For balances, pair the `address_id` with both `transfer_type` and `value_type` in `GET /accounts/{account_id}/addresses/{address_id}/balance`.
